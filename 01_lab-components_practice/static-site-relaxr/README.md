# React Components

The Relaxr team wants their website re-written in React so it is easier to manage and can eventually be connected to their API.  They've supplied us the [code for the original website](/relaxr).  Create componenents for the following parts of the page.  Be sure to organize the CSS as well.

- Header 
- Benefits section
- Testimonial section
- Aside 
- Footer
- Update the "Sign Up Now" and "Get it Now" buttons to both be "Sign Up Now" so you can use the same component
